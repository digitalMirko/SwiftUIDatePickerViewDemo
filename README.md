# SwiftUIDatePickerViewDemo
Swift - Swift UIDatePickerView Demo - Demo 21 of 30

App created in Xcode 11.0 using Swift 5.0, iOS Deployment Target 13.0 and tested on a iPhone 11 Pro Max Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a Swift UIDatePicker View with various results displayed on labels rite above.

There are so many interesting things within swift. This demo shows one way to setup the UIDatePicker View on the bottom of 
the app and then on top in a series of labels the various results that can be displayed on the screen. As the user clicks
the icon they are taken right into the app and the UIDatePicker View is set by default on todays date.

Then on the top is a title for the demo 'UIDatePicker View Demo' followed by a series of eight labels positioned over each
other with code to show the various outputs that can be displayed from the selections made on the Picker unit below.
